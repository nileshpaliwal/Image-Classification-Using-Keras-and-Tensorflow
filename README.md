# Image Classification

## Description
Fashion training set consists of 70,000 images divided into 60,000 training and 10,000 testing samples. Dataset sample consists of 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

The 10 classes are as follows:
0 => T-shirt/top 1 => Trouser 2 => Pullover 3 => Dress 4 => Coat 5 => Sandal 6 => Shirt 7 => Sneaker 8 => Bag 9 => Ankle boot

Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255.

## Dataset
The experimental study is based on the fashion-MNIST dataset. [Dataset Link](https://sds-platform-private.s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/P39-Fashion-MNIST-Datasets.zip)
You can find further informations about the dataset on [Zalando Research](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist) This dataset is a great option instead of using traditional handwritten MNIST.
